# Two-population-simulation

The simulation was conducted using the C++ programming language, and subsequent data analysis was carried out using Python. Following the principles of the Gillespie algorithm, we initialized the model with a variable number of Cryptococcus cells (Called N_0 ) ranging from 1 to 1000 . We iterate for 100 times for every initial value of N 0 . The simulation output yielded a dataset consisting of the number of Cn cells as the rst entry and the corresponding simulation time as the second entry.
